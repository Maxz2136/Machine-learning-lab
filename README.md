# Machine-learning-lab
This repository contains code for various machine learning model built during Machine learning lab

## Assignment 1

Basic python code for understanding libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit etc.

## Assignment 2

Basic python code to illustrate statistical operations such as variance, covariance, mean, median, mode and pearson correlation cofficient

## Assignment 3

Implementation of a linear regression algorithm to approximate a one variable and multivariable function. Illustration of training done using both least square method and gradient descent is present. <br>
Implementing and training a linear regression model on **Boston Housing dataset** to predict the house prices


## Assignment 4

1. Ilustration of curve fitting of various polynomial function of different degree on a single training set.
2. Implementing a logistic regression model on **Wisconsin breast cancer dataset** to classify data samples as Benign or Malignant tumor. <br>
    **Todo:** Increase the accuracy of the model, currently on average around 62 (MAE)
